            DATA TYPES
            
            THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF DATA TYPES IN JAVA

            1. PRIMITIVE
            2. NON-PRIMITIVE

            IN PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES THERE ARE 8 TYPES OF DATA TYPES

            1. BYTE    RANGE:- -128 TO 127
            2. SHORT   RANGE:- -32768 TO 32767
            3. INT     RANGE:- -2147483648 TO 2147483647
            4. LONG    RANGE:- -9223372036854775808 TO 9223372036854775807
            5. FLOAT   RANGE:- 3.4e-038 TO 3.4e+038
            6. DOUBLE  RANGE:- 1.7e-308 TO 1.7e+308
            7. CHAR    RANGE:- 0 TO 65535
            8. BOOLEAN RANGE:- TRUE OR FALSE

            IN NON-PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES THERE ARE 4 TYPES OF DATA TYPES

            1. STRING Defination:- String is a sequence of characters
            2. ARRAY Defination:- Array is a collection of similar data types
            3. CLASS Defination:- Class is a blueprint for the object
            4. INTERFACE Defination:- Interface is a collection of abstract methods


        
    To take input from user in java we use Scanner class.
    Scanner can be used to read input of all primitive types.
    it can be imported from java.util package.

    Syntax:- java.util.Scanner;

    to import all the pacakges of java.util package we can use

    Syntax:- import java.util.*;

    to create an object of Scanner class we use
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

    to read input from user we use
    sc.nextInt();

    sc. is the object of Scanner class and nextInt() is the method of Scanner class.

    next.Int or nextDouble or nextFloat or nextLong or nextShort or nextByte or nextBoolean or nextLine

    we can use by the following syntaxes

    Scanner sc = new scanner(System.in);

    int a = sc.nextInt();
    double b = sc.nextDouble();
    float c = sc.nextFloat();
    long d = sc.nextLong(); 
    short e = sc.nextShort();
    byte f = sc.nextByte();
    boolean g = sc.nextBoolean();
    String h = sc.nextLine();


    are used to store the input of respective data types.
